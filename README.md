# Plugin Compilation
This repository provides tools for compiling C++ code as native modules for Node.js, focusing on two cellular automata algorithms:

1. **Conway's Game of Life**:  
    Implements the classic cellular automaton devised by John Conway. The algorithm simulates the evolution of a grid of cells based on simple rules, demonstrating how complex patterns can emerge from basic interactions. The C++ implementation showcases performance benefits for computationally intensive simulations.

2. **Lenia**:  
    Implements the Lenia cellular automaton, a continuous generalization of cellular automata that allows for more complex and lifelike behaviors. This algorithm highlights the flexibility and efficiency of C++ for simulating advanced, real-time cellular systems.

**Purpose:**  
The goal of this repository is to develop high-performance algorithms that compute results quickly while ensuring simple, plug-and-play integration as native Node.js modules. This approach leverages the power of C++ for intensive tasks, making it easy to use these modules in JavaScript projects without complex configuration.
